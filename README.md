# KTH-IK1203: Networks and Communication
## What did I learn? 
- [x] Learned transport layer protocols (TCP and UDP)
- [x] Learned communication models (Client-server and Peer-to-peer)
- [x] Learned LAN networks and systems (Ethernet, wireless, bridged, topologies, access techniques etc.)
- [x] Learned layered models (TCP/IP and overview of OpenSystemInterconnection[physical, datalink, network, transport, application]) 
- [x] Learned flow and error control (sliding window, stop & wait, detections, codes, retransmission [ARQ] etc.)
- [x] Learned packet and circuit switching (WAN, public networks, principles, characteristics, protocols)
- [x] Learned Internetworking and IP (design pricniples and building blocks, connection-oriented vs connectionsless, internet routing and protocol)

## Network Lab
- task1: Implemented a TCP-client (connection, print the received data, send data to the server as a string parameter)
- task2: Implemented a webserver (accept incoming TCP, read until client closes, echos back the read data as a HTTP response)
- task3: Implemented a webserver which calls the TCP-client and displays the result as a webpage 
- task4: Implemented a concurrent webserver of the same type as in task3 (multiple clients in parallel, an incoming client is server immediately)
## Exercises
- task1: HTTP, SMTP, POP3 analyse with Wireshark
- task2: Install and configure a VM, Operations of DHCP, operations of a DNS server in a network
- task3: Network design, address range within organizations, network elements connections, config router to LANS by adding static routes, network trouble shooting
